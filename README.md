# Danger Duck

A 2D top-down shooter built with the Godot Engine.

The game jam encouraged developers to make games with "bad" art. I decided to crowdsource graphics from my close friends, and put them into the game. All of their graphics and attributations are available in the credits.

Made for the "*I Can't Draw But Want to Make a Game (Again)*" game jam on [Itch.io](https://kiptoke.itch.io/danger-duck).
